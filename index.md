# About Me

<img title="" src="file:///C:/Users/YGQ/Documents/GitHub/jetw92.github.io/images/wz1.jpg" alt="">

Here is **Zhuo Wang**.

In this year, I got my master's degree in pharmacy. My degree thesis was about **organic synthesis methodology** and **medicinal chemistry**.I am really interested in research that intersects biology and organic chemistry because organic chemistry is a well-developed and useful tool to solve many life's problems. Especially, developing small molecules to treat diseases, which is still the main focus of therapeutic drug development because of its strong practicability, accommodation, acceptability, and economic value. After my first postgraduate study, I found that I really enjoy this area. It seems to design and produce powerful weapons to protect humankind. Thus, I studied for the master's degree in pharmacy. 

Currently, **<font color='navyblue'> I am looking for PhD position in medicinal chemistry or related area to start in 2023 or 2024 Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!</font>**
